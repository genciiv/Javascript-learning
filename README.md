### What is Javascript?

JavaScript is basically known as the language of the most modern web browser .
JavaScript is powerful , flexible and fast programming language now being used for increasingly complex web development and beyond.
JavaScript powers the dynamic behavior on the most websites of internet.

We going to learn introductory coding concepts including data types and buid in objects .
With this you'll understanding the more complex concepts

### Code Editor 
To start coding with JavaScript you need a code editor to put your code there.
VS Code is the code editor we are going to use here.
Download the [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
Run VSCode and create new file javascript1.html
Open the Chrome side by side and open the newly created file there.

### Web Browser 
To watch output of Javascript code you need a browser
Google Chrome is the browser we are going to use here 
Download [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIqMCoyZr5-QIVSAsGAB0mxAT0EAAYASABEgK46fD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
Run Chrome and open the newly created file there.

### HTML Template 
To write JavaScript code inside html file you need to create script tag.
You need to put this code inside javascript1.html
<script>
    // here is your javascript1 code goes
</script>

### JavaScript Console

The javascript console is a panel that displays important messages , like errors , for developers .
If we want to see console , find javascript console in your web browser .

### Console
In JavaScript , the console keyword refers to an object , a collection of data and actions , that we can use in our code.
Keywords are words that are build into the JavaScript language so the computer will recognize them and treats them specially.

### Console.log
One action , or method , that is buit into the console object is the .log() method.
When we write console.log() what we put inside the parentheses will get printed, or logged to the console . 
It is going to be veryuseful for us to values to the console , so we can see the work that we are doing.
Let type this code in editor and see the result in console .
