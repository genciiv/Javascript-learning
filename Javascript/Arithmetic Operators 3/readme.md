# Arithmetic Operators

Basic arithmetic often comes in handly when programming .
An operator is character that performs a task in our code.
JavaScript has several built in arithmetic operators , that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers.
These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols.

# Add  : +
# Substract : -
# Multiply : *
# Devine : /
# Remainder : %

### Example
The first four work how you might guess :
console.log (3+4); //print 7
console.log(5-1); //print 4
console.log(4*2); //print 8
console.log(9/3); //print 3

Note that when we console.log() the conputer will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses and print that resultto the console
If we wanted to print the characters 3+4 , we would wrap them in quotes and print them as a string.
The remainder operator, returnsthe number that remains after the right hand number divides into the left hand number as many times as it evenly can : 11%3 equal 2 because 3 fit into 11 three times , leaving 2 as the remainder.

### Exercise 

Inside of console.log(), add 3.5 to your age.
This is the age you will be when we start sending people to live in Mars.
On new line write another console.log(), take the current year and substruct 1969.
The answer is how many years it is been since the 1969 moon landing.
Create another console.log(). Inside parentheses divide 65 by 240 .
Create one last console.log(). Inside the parentheses,multiply 0.2708 by 100.
That's the percent of the sun that is made up of helium . Assuming we could stand on the sun, we'd all sound like chipmunks.

console.log(31+3.5);
console.log(2022-1969;
console.log(65/240);
console.log(0.2708*100);
