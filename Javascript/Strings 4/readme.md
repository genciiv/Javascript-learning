### String Concatenation
Operators arent just for numbers! When a + operator is used on two strings. It append the right string to the left string:
console.log("hi" + "Ya"); //prints 'hiYa'
console.log('wo'+'ah');//prints 'woah'
console.log('i love to'+'code')//prints 'i love to code'
This process of appending one string to another is called concatenation. Notice in the third example we had to make sure to include a space at the end of the first string.

The computer will join the strings exactly , so we needed to make sure to include the space we wanted between the two strings :
conssole.log('front' + 'space');
conssole.log('back' + 'space');
conssole.log('no' + 'space');

Just like with regular math , we can combine or chain our operations to get a final result :
console.log('one '+'two '+'three');

### Exercise 
Inside a console.log() statement , concatenate the two strings 'Hello' and 'World'
