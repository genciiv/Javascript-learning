## Properties

When you introduce a new piece of data into a JavaScript program , the browser saves it as an  instace of the data type.
Every string instance has a property called length that stores the number of characters in that string.
You can retrieve property information by appending the string with a period and the property name :

console.log('Hello'.length);

The . is another operator ! We call it dot operator.

In example above , the value saved to the length property is retrieved from the instance of the string 'Hello'.
The program prints 5 to the console , because Hello has 5 characters in it.

### Exercise 

Use the .lenght property to log the number of characters in the following string to the console :
'Teaching the world how to code'.
