# Data Types
Data types are the classifications we give to the different kinds of data that we use in programming . In JavaScript , there are seven fundamental data types :

- Number : Any number . including numbers with decimals : 4,8,1516,23.42.
- String : Any grouping of characters on your keyboard (Letters,numbers,spacees,symbols,ect) sorronded by single quotes '..' Though we prefer single quotes. Some people like to think of strings as a fancy word for text.
- Boolean : This data type only has two possible values - either trueor false . It's helpful to think of booleans as on and off switched or as the answer to a "yes" or "no"
- Null : This data type represent the intentional absence of a value , and is represented by the keyword null (without quotes)
- Undefined : This data type is denoted by the keyword undefined(without quotes). It also represent the absence of a value though it has a difference use than null.
- Symbol : A newer feature to the laguage , symbols are unique identifiers , useful in more complex coding . No need to worry about these for now.
- Object : Collections of related data

The first 6 of those types are consider primitive data types . They are the most basic data types in the language.
console.log('I love Javascript');
console.log('40');
In the example above,we first printed a string . Our string isnt just a single word, it includes both capital and lowercase letters,spaces and punctuation
Next , we printed the number 40 , notice we di not use quotes.

## Exercise
- On line 1 log the string 'Javascript' to the console.
- On line 2 , log the number 2011 to the console.
- On line 3 , print 'Wowww'! I love to code! #codecademy to the console.
- On line 4 , print the number 20.49 to the console.
