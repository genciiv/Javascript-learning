## Methods

console.log('hello'.toUppercase()); prints HELLO
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H'));prints true

Let's look at each of th lines above :

On the first line , the toUpperCase() method is called on the string instance 'hello' .
The result is looged to the console . This method returns a string in all capital letters 'HELLO'

On the second line , the .startsWith() method is called on the string instance 'Hey' . 
This method also accept the character 'H' as an input , or argument , between the parentheses . Since the string 'Hey'
does start with the letter 'H' , the method returns the boolean true.

## Exercise 
Use the .toUpperCase() method to log the string 'iLoveCoding' to the console in all capital letters

console.log('iLoveCoding'.toUpperCase());

console.log('        iLoveCoding       '.trim());    trim remove the spaces
