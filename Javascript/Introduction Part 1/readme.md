### Comments
Our own code can quickly become difficult to understand when we return to it . 
So it is often useful to leave notes in our code for other developers or ourselfs.
As we write Javascript , we can write comments in our code that the computer will ignore as our program runs. These comments exist just for human readers. 
Comments can explain what the code is doing , leave instructions for developers using the code , or add any other useful annotations.

There are two types of code comments in JavaScript
A single line comment will comment out a single line and is denoted with two forward slashes it . 

console.log(5)
You can also use a single line comment to comment after a line of code 
console.log(5); // Prints 5.

A multiline comment will comment out multiple lines and is denoted with /* to begin the comment and */ to end the comment
/*
This is all commented
console.log(10);
None of this is going to run
*/

## Exercise 
Let's practice adding some code comment 
Print you name at line 1 , your age at line 2 , your sex at line 3 and your hobbies at line 4
On line 1 , write a single line comment that say your age
On line 2 comment the whole line to ignore the command
Use multi-line comment to comment line 3 and 4
